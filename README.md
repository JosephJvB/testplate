## ROADMAP: [

* HTML {
  - path: /server/public/index.html
  - supplies dom element div w/ class 'app'
}


  * JS {
    - path: /client/index.js
    - injects all app elements into html (reactDOM.render)
  }


   * JS {
       - path: /client/app/index.js
       - makes redux and fela providers available to app
      }


      * JS {
        - path: /client/app/routes.js
        - routes the app, renders top level page components
      }
